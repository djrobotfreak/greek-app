# GoodUI Notes (in progress)
1. Try a one column layout instead of multi-columns.

> I think by having a mobile first design outlook, this will naturally occur. Simple design is better.

2. Try giving a gift instead of closing a sale right away.

> We can do this with our sign up page.

3. Try merging similar functions instead of fragmenting the UI.

> I think this is important to keep in mind so we can keep our main functions simple.

4. Try social proof instead of talking about yourself.

> This will be good to do when we get good reviews.

5. Try repeating your primary action instead of just showing it once.

> This will be good to think about when crafting our emails.

6. Try distinct clickable/selected styles instead of blurring them.

> I think we do this well, maybe should add more active states or make it clearer where the user is in the app.

7. Try recommending instead of showing equal choices

> N/a
atom
8. Try undos instead of prompting for confirmation.
[link](https://www.goodui.org/#8)
> I think there are a few places we could do this.

9. Try telling who it's for instead of targeting everyone.

> I'm not sure if we have a clause for who NeteGreek is for and isn't.

10. Try being direct instead of indecisive.
[link](https://www.goodui.org/#10)
> Make sure we are intentional with our language.

11. Try more contrast instead of similarity.
[link](https://www.goodui.org/#11)
> Good to look at for our emails.

12. Try personality instead of being generic.
[link](https://www.goodui.org/#12)
> I think we could try to look for places to do that. We used to with our loading screen, but now it loads too fast 
for that.

13. Try fewer form fields instead of asking for too many.
[link](https://www.goodui.org/#13)
> Let's go back and make sure we're only displaying necessary fields for the signup process.

14. Try exposing options instead of hiding them.
[link](https://www.goodui.org/#14)
> I think we do a good job of this in chatter.

15. Try suggesting continuity instead of false bottoms.
[link](https://www.goodui.org/#15)
> Considering that all of our sections are list items that run together, I think we're good to go there.
