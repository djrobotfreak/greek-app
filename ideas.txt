It might be good to consider working with SeedSumo.
Pros: facilities, extra money, good connections, more validation, access to mentors
Cons: give up some equity, not needed for success


Look into enabling compression and how caching works in modern browsers.

$ROOT.SCOPE
    Data needed to load at beginning:
    - Logged in user information
    - Directory List

HOME
    We'll need an attractive page front with a CTA and some good reviews.
    Also need to have an about page with more information and maybe a video.

REGISTERINFO
    I was having a problem where the register accountinfo page would take me to the login screen.

PAYMENT
    Freemium Model - allow organizations to use the directory for free
    if they want to use other feature sets such as the messaging, events, or polls then they can pay $2/member/month
    (try the first semester at 50% discount)
    If we go with a freemium model we can move the payments section into the dropdown menu.
    
APP
    I'm thinking the home page will be like an inbox for all the notifications for that user.
    
MANAGE MEMBERS
    We'll have to think through how we transfer members to alumni and such.
    What other things can we do with members.
    Add to COUNCIL, LEADERSHIP or remove their permissions.
    Set pledge class? Edit account information?
    
UPLOAD PROFILE PICTURE
    Do we want to set a max file size on the profile pictures?
    Do we want to resize the picture and possibly save different sizes for performance?


DESIGN

Let's focus on the navigation and then 2 views to start.
Then based off of how we theme those we can design any outstanding elements based off of how we do them.
The apphome page and the tagging members page.
